# List of tasks

The following are the key targets for delivering the coding assessment for Zigzag Gengo Solutions

1. [Setup](#setup)
2. [Documentation](#documentation)
3. [Implement functions](#implement-functions)
4. [Implement APIs](#implement-apis)

## Setup

1. Update template to suit the requirements
    1. Remove unnecessary features
    2. Add base for unit testing and code coverage
2. Add production setting for logging
3. Implement git pre-push hooks to execute unit tests

## Documentation

Update README.md to add instructions for running the server. Add descriptions about the implementation for each solution required.

## Implement functions

1. Check if palindrome
  > Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and that returns a boolean representing whether the string is a palindrome.
2. Find longest palindrome
  > Now write a function that, given a string, returns its longest palindromic substring. You can assume that there will only be one longest palindromic substring.
3. Count least number of palindromes
  > Now write a function that returns the minimum number of cuts needed to perform on the string such that each remaining substring is a palindrome.

## Implement APIs

Create an API for each function for easy validation.

Add unit test for each implementation. Make sure that test coverage should be atleast `80%` across lines and statements
